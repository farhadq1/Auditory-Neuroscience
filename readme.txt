Introduction

The software is built for visualizing auditory neural data comprising of
spikes or action potentials recorded in response to complex acoustic
stimulation. The visualization maps the data on 3 domains: frequency,
intensity and time, the 3 fundamentals of acoustic signals.


Data

The data consists of processed neural spikes in response to acoustic stimulation.
After initial processing of the spikes with respect to the frequency, intensity and
timing after tone onset data was arranged in a 3D matrix. The 3D matrix consists of
2D Frequency Time values stacked for each sound intensity level used.
